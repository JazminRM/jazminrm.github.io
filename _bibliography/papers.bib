              signals, based on integrated haplotype scores and population
              branch statistics, in 325 Mexican Indigenous individuals with at
              least 99\% Native American ancestry from five previously defined
              geographical regions. Although each region exhibited its own

              regulators of the Wnt/$\beta$ catenin signaling pathway, showed
              significant adaptation signals in all the tested regions. Several
              signals were found, mainly in the genes related to the metabolic
              processes and immune response. A pathway enrichment analysis
              revealed the overrepresentation of selected genes related to

              are major drivers of human adaptation. Genes related to the gut

              the last Ice Age when many other large mammal species went
              extinct. Little is known, however, about the history and possible
              extinction of past wolf populations or when and where the wolf
              progenitors of the present-day dog lineage (Canis familiaris)
              lived1-8. Here we analysed 72 ancient wolf genomes spanning the
              last 100,000 years from Europe, Siberia and North America. We
              found that wolf populations were highly connected throughout the
              Late Pleistocene, with levels of differentiation an order of
              magnitude lower than they are today. This population connectivity
              allowed us to detect natural selection across the time series,
              including rapid fixation of mutations in the gene IFT88
              40,000-30,000 years ago. We show that dogs are overall more
              closely related to ancient wolves from eastern Eurasia than to
              those from western Eurasia, suggesting a domestication process in
              the east. However, we also found that dogs in the Near East and
              Africa derive up to half of their ancestry from a distinct
              population related to modern southwest Eurasian wolves,
              reflecting either an independent domestication process or
              admixture from local wolves. None of the analysed ancient wolf
              genomes is a direct match for either of these dog ancestries,

              which includes the ability to endure complete desiccation, high
              levels of radiation and very low sub-zero temperatures.
              Nevertheless, tardigrades appear to be vulnerable to high
              temperatures and thus the potential effects of global warming.
              Here, we provide the first analysis of transcriptome data
              obtained from heat stressed specimens of the eutardigrade
              Ramazzottius varieornatus, with the aim of providing new insights
              into the molecular processes affected by high temperatures.
              Specifically, we compare RNA-seq datasets obtained from active,
              heat-exposed (35 °C) tardigrades to that of active controls kept
              at 5 °C. Our data reveal a surprising shift in transcription,
              involving 9634 differentially expressed transcripts,
              corresponding to >35\% of the transcriptome. The latter data are
              in striking contrast to the hitherto observed constitutive
              expression underlying tardigrade extreme stress tolerance and
              entrance into the latent state of life, known as cryptobiosis.
              Thus, when examining the molecular response, heat-stress appears
              to be more stressful for R. varieornatus than extreme conditions,
              such as desiccation or freezing. A gene ontology analysis reveals
              that the heat stress response involves a change in transcription
              and presumably translation, including an adjustment of
              metabolism, and, putatively, preparation for encystment and
              subsequent diapause. Among the differentially expressed
              transcripts we find heat-shock proteins as well as the
              eutardigrade specific proteins (CAHS, SAHS, MAHS, RvLEAM, and
              Dsup). The latter proteins thus seem to contribute to a general
              stress response, and may not be directly related to cryptobiosis.",

              among the most freeze-tolerant animals, with selected species
              reported to survive milli-Kelvin temperatures. Here, we estimate
              survival of fully hydrated eutardigrades of the species
              Ramazzottius varieornatus following exposures to -20 °C and -80
              °C as well as -196 °C with or without initial cooling to -80 °C.
              The tardigrades easily survive these temperatures, yet with a
              significant decrease in viability following rapid cooling by
              direct exposure to -196 °C. Hence, post-freeze recovery of R.
              varieornatus seems to rely on cooling rate and thus controlled
              ice formation. Cryophilic organisms are renowned for having
              cold-active enzymes that secure appropriate reaction rates at low
              temperatures. Hence, extreme freeze-tolerance in R. varieornatus
              could potentially involve syntheses of cryoprotectants and de
              novo transcription. We therefore generated a reference
              transcriptome for this cryophilic R. varieornatus population and
              explored for differential gene expression patterns following
              cooling to -80 °C as compared to active 5 °C controls.
              Specifically, we tested for fast transcription potentially
              occurring within 25 min of cooling from room temperature to a
              supercooling point of ca. -20 °C, at which the tardigrades
              presumably freeze and enter into the ametabolic state of
              cryobiosis. Our analyses revealed no evidence for differential
              gene expression. We, therefore, conclude that extreme
              freeze-tolerance in R. varieornatus relies on controlled
              extracellular freezing with any freeze-tolerance related genes
              being constitutively expressed.",

              findings that suggest domestication occurred between 10,000 and
              6,250 years ago in southern Mexico [3, 4]. Maize rapidly evolved
              under human selection, leading to conspicuous phenotypic
              transformations, as well as adaptations to varied environments
              [5]. Still, many questions about the domestication process remain
              unanswered because modern specimens do not represent the full
              range of past diversity due to abandonment of unproductive
              lineages, genetic drift, on-going natural selection, and recent
              breeding activity. To more fully understand the history and

  abstract = "Homotherium was a genus of large-bodied scimitar-toothed cats,
              morphologically distinct from any extant felid species, that went
              extinct at the end of the Pleistocene [1-4]. They possessed
              large, saber-form serrated canine teeth, powerful forelimbs, a
              sloping back, and an enlarged optic bulb, all of which were key
              characteristics for predation on Pleistocene megafauna [5].
              Previous mitochondrial DNA phylogenies suggested that it was a
              highly divergent sister lineage to all extant cat species [6-8].
              However, mitochondrial phylogenies can be misled by hybridization
              [9], incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), or sex-biased dispersal
              patterns [10], which might be especially relevant for Homotherium
              since widespread mito-nuclear discrepancies have been uncovered
              in modern cats [10]. To examine the evolutionary history of
              Homotherium, we generated a ∼7x nuclear genome and a ∼38x exome
              from H. latidens using shotgun and target-capture sequencing
              approaches. Phylogenetic analyses reveal Homotherium as highly
              divergent (∼22.5 Ma) from living cat species, with no detectable
              signs of gene flow. Comparative genomic analyses found signatures
              of positive selection in several genes, including those involved
              in vision, cognitive function, and energy consumption, putatively
              consistent with diurnal activity, well-developed social behavior,
              and cursorial hunting [5]. Finally, we uncover relatively high
              levels of genetic diversity, suggesting that Homotherium may have

              phylogenetically distinct clades: Eurasian and American wolves
              and domestic dogs.1 Genetic studies have suggested these groups
              trace their origins to a wolf population that expanded during the
              last glacial maximum (LGM)1-3 and replaced local wolf
              populations.4 Moreover, ancient genomes from the Yana basin and
              the Taimyr peninsula provided evidence of at least one extinct
              wolf lineage that dwelled in Siberia during the Pleistocene.35
              Previous studies have suggested that Pleistocene Siberian canids
              can be classified into two groups based on cranial morphology.
              Wolves in the first group are most similar to present-day
              populations, although those in the second group possess
              intermediate features between dogs and wolves.67 However, whether
              this morphological classification represents distinct genetic
              groups remains unknown. To investigate this question and the
              relationships between Pleistocene canids, present-day wolves, and
              dogs, we resequenced the genomes of four Pleistocene canids from
              Northeast Siberia dated between >50 and 14 ka old, including
              samples from the two morphological categories. We found these
              specimens cluster with the two previously sequenced Pleistocene
              wolves, which are genetically more similar to Eurasian wolves.
              Our results show that, though the four specimens represent
              extinct wolf lineages, they do not form a monophyletic group.
              Instead, each Pleistocene Siberian canid branched off the lineage
              that gave rise to present-day wolves and dogs. Finally, our
              results suggest the two previously described morphological groups
              could represent independent lineages similarly related to
              present-day wolves and dogs.",

              Despite this, the majority of SE Asia's genetic diversity is
              still poorly characterized. The growing interest in using
              environmental DNA to assess and monitor SE Asian species, in
              particular threatened mammals-has created the urgent need to
              expand the available reference database of mitochondrial barcode
              and complete mitogenome sequences. We have partially addressed
              this need by generating 72 new mitogenome sequences reconstructed
              from DNA isolated from a range of historical and modern tissue
              samples. Approximately 55 gigabases of raw sequence were
              generated. From this data, we assembled 72 complete mitogenome
              sequences, with an average depth of coverage of $\times$102.9 and
              $\times$55.2 for modern samples and historical samples,
              respectively. This dataset represents 52 species, of which 30
              species had no previous mitogenome data available. The
              mitogenomes were geotagged to their sampling location, where
              known, to display a detailed geographical distribution of the
              species. Our new database of 52 taxa will strongly enhance the
              utility of environmental DNA approaches for monitoring mammals in
              SE Asia as it greatly increases the likelihoods that
              identification of metabarcoding sequencing reads can be assigned

              questions are often investigated using the genomic sequences of
              organelles: mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA. Organellar genomes
              are found in multiple copies per living cell, increasing their
              chance of recovery from archaeological samples, and are inherited
              from one parent without genetic recombination, simplifying

              plant chloroplast genomes (plastomes) may be at elucidating
              questions related to plant evolution, crop domestication, and the
              prehistoric movement of botanical products through trade and

              and/or animal physiology affect the number of eccDNAs. Here, we

              genome, using Columba livia domestica (domestic rock pigeon) as a
              model organism. By sequencing eccDNA in blood and breast muscle
              from three pigeon breeds at various ages and with different
              flight behavior, we characterize 30,000 unique eccDNAs. We

              circularization in breast muscle, including genes involved in
              muscle development. We find that although eccDNA counts do not

              speciation, migration and admixture events for extinct taxa1.
              However, the irreversible post-mortem degradation2 of ancient DNA
              has so far limited its recovery-outside permafrost areas-to
              specimens that are not older than approximately 0.5 million years
              (Myr)3. By contrast, tandem mass spectrometry has enabled the
              sequencing of approximately 1.5-Myr-old collagen type I4, and
              suggested the presence of protein residues in fossils of the
              Cretaceous period5-although with limited phylogenetic use6. In
              the absence of molecular evidence, the speciation of several
              extinct species of the Early and Middle Pleistocene epoch remains
              contentious. Here we address the phylogenetic relationships of
              the Eurasian Rhinocerotidae of the Pleistocene epoch7-9, using
              the proteome of dental enamel from a Stephanorhinus tooth that is
              approximately 1.77-Myr old, recovered from the archaeological
              site of Dmanisi (South Caucasus, Georgia)10. Molecular
              phylogenetic analyses place this Stephanorhinus as a sister group
              to the clade formed by the woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta
              antiquitatis) and Merck's rhinoceros (Stephanorhinus
              kirchbergensis). We show that Coelodonta evolved from an early
              Stephanorhinus lineage, and that this latter genus includes at
              least two distinct evolutionary lines. The genus Stephanorhinus
              is therefore currently paraphyletic, and its systematic revision
              is needed. We demonstrate that sequencing the proteome of Early
              Pleistocene dental enamel overcomes the limitations of
              phylogenetic inference based on ancient collagen or DNA. Our
              approach also provides additional information about the sex and
              taxonomic assignment of other specimens from Dmanisi. Our
              findings reveal that proteomic investigation of ancient dental
              enamel-which is the hardest tissue in vertebrates11, and is
              highly abundant in the fossil record-can push the reconstruction

              ancient DNA in the archaeological record. Although most DNA
              within calculus is microbial, it has been shown to contain
              sufficient human DNA for the targeted retrieval of whole
              mitochondrial genomes. Here, we explore whether calculus is also
              a viable substrate for whole human genome recovery using targeted
              enrichment techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total DNA extracted
              from 24 paired archaeological human dentin and calculus samples
              was subjected to whole human genome enrichment using in-solution
              hybridization capture and high-throughput sequencing. RESULTS:
              Total DNA from calculus exceeded that of dentin in all cases, and
              although the proportion of human DNA was generally lower in
              calculus, the absolute human DNA content of calculus and dentin
              was not significantly different. Whole genome enrichment resulted
              in up to four-fold enrichment of the human endogenous DNA content
              for both dentin and dental calculus libraries, albeit with some
              loss in complexity. Recovering more on-target reads for the same
              sequencing effort generally improved the quality of downstream
              analyses, such as sex and ancestry estimation. For nonhuman DNA,
              comparison of phylum-level microbial community structure revealed
              few differences between precapture and postcapture libraries,
              indicating that off-target sequences in human genome-enriched
              calculus libraries may still be useful for oral microbiome
              reconstruction. DISCUSSION: While ancient human dental calculus
              does contain endogenous human DNA sequences, their relative
              proportion is low when compared with other skeletal tissues.
              Whole genome enrichment can help increase the proportion of
              recovered human reads, but in this instance enrichment efficiency
              was relatively low when compared with other forms of capture. We
              conclude that further optimization is necessary before the method
              can be routinely applied to archaeological samples.",

              hominins that appear later in the fossil record during the Middle
              Pleistocene epoch, such as Homo sapiens, are highly debated1-5.
              For the oldest remains, the molecular study of these
              relationships is hindered by the degradation of ancient DNA.
              However, recent research has demonstrated that the analysis of
              ancient proteins can address this challenge6-8. Here we present
              the dental enamel proteomes of H. antecessor from Atapuerca
              (Spain)9,10 and Homo erectus from Dmanisi (Georgia)1, two key
              fossil assemblages that have a central role in models of
              Pleistocene hominin morphology, dispersal and divergence. We
              provide evidence that H. antecessor is a close sister lineage to
              subsequent Middle and Late Pleistocene hominins, including modern
              humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans. This placement implies that
              the modern-like face of H. antecessor-that is, similar to that of
              modern humans-may have a considerably deep ancestry in the genus
              Homo, and that the cranial morphology of Neanderthals represents
              a derived form. By recovering AMELY-specific peptide sequences,
              we also conclude that the H. antecessor molar fragment from
              Atapuerca that we analysed belonged to a male individual.
              Finally, these H. antecessor and H. erectus fossils preserve
              evidence of enamel proteome phosphorylation and proteolytic
              digestion that occurred in vivo during tooth formation. Our
              results provide important insights into the evolutionary

              pave the way for future studies using enamel proteomes to

              Gigantopithecus and extinct and extant hominids are wide ranging

              dentognathic morphology, the absence of cranial and post-cranial

              We retrieved dental enamel proteome sequences from a
              1.9-million-year-old G. blacki molar found in Chuifeng Cave,

              the region continues to be home to a high diversity of wild and
              cultivated grapevines, particularly within Georgia. The earliest
              chemical evidence for wine making was recorded in Georgian
              Neolithic sites (6000--5800 bc) and grape pips, possibly of the
              domesticated morphotype, have been reported from several sites of
              about the same period. We performed geometric morphometric and
              palaeogenomic investigations of grape pip samples in order to
              identify the appearance of domesticated grapevine and explore the
              changes in cultivated diversity in relation to modern varieties.
              We systematically investigated charred and uncharred grape pip
              samples from Georgian archaeological sites. Their chronology was
              thoroughly assessed by direct radiocarbon dating. More than 500
              grape pips from 14 sites from the Middle Bronze Age to modern
              times were selected for geometric morphometric studies. The
              shapes of the ancient pips were compared to hundreds of modern
              wild individuals and cultivated varieties. Degraded DNA was
              isolated from three pips from two sites, converted to Illumina
              libraries, sequenced at approximately 10,000 single nucleotide
              polymorphism (SNP) sites, and compared to a large public database
              of grapevine diversity. The most ancient pip dates from the
              Middle Bronze Age (1900--1500 cal bc) and the domesticated
              morphotype is identified from ca. 1000 bc onwards. A great
              diversity of domesticated shapes was regularly seen in the
              samples. Most are close to modern cultivars from the Caucasian,
              southwest Asian and Balkan areas, which suggests that the modern
              local vine diversity is deeply rooted in early viticulture. DNA
              was successfully recovered from historic pips and genome-wide
              analyses found close parental relationships to modern Georgian

              pressure, and their populations are declining fast. The white
              rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) is a paradigmatic case: this
              African megaherbivore has suffered a remarkable decline in the
              last 150 years due to human activities. Its subspecies, the
              northern (NWR) and the southern white rhinoceros (SWR), however,
              underwent opposite fates: the NWR vanished quickly, while the SWR
              recovered after the severe decline. Such demographic events are
              predicted to have an erosive effect at the genomic level, linked
              to the extirpation of diversity, and increased genetic drift and
              inbreeding. However, there is little empirical data available to
              directly reconstruct the subtleties of such processes in light of
              distinct demographic histories. Therefore, we generated a
              whole-genome, temporal data set consisting of 52 resequenced
              white rhinoceros genomes, representing both subspecies at two
              time windows: before and during/after the bottleneck. Our data

              heterozygosity decreased significantly by 10\% in the NWR and
              36\% in the SWR, and inbreeding coefficients rose significantly

              genomic diversity and recent inbreeding it suffered, the only

              Siberian communities. Although Arctic Siberian groups such as the
              Nenets received limited gene flow from neighboring groups,
              archaeological evidence suggests that metallurgy and new
              subsistence strategies emerged in Northwest Siberia around 2,000
              y ago. It is unclear if the Siberian Arctic dog population was as
              continuous as the people of the region or if instead admixture
              occurred, possibly in relation to the influx of material culture
              from other parts of Eurasia. To address this question, we
              sequenced and analyzed the genomes of 20 ancient and historical
              Siberian and Eurasian Steppe dogs. Our analyses indicate that
              while Siberian dogs were genetically homogenous between 9,500 to
              7,000 y ago, later introduction of dogs from the Eurasian Steppe
              and Europe led to substantial admixture. This is clearly the case
              in the Iamal-Nenets region (Northwestern Siberia) where dogs from
              the Iron Age period (∼2,000 y ago) possess substantially less
              ancestry related to European and Steppe dogs than dogs from the
              medieval period (∼1,000 y ago). Combined with findings of
              nonlocal materials recovered from these archaeological sites,
              including glass beads and metal items, these results indicate
              that Northwest Siberian communities were connected to a larger
              trade network through which they acquired genetically distinctive
              dogs from other regions. These exchanges were part of a series of
              major societal changes, including the rise of large-scale
