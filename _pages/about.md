I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Globe Institute in the University of Copenhagen. I am interested in understanding the evolutionary processes behind domestication. My work is focused on studying the dispersion patterns, gene-flow and adaptation of domesticated species such as maize, grapes, wolves and dogs, using ancient DNA.

I am currently a postdoc in the <a href="https://globe.ku.dk/research/hologenomics/gopalakrishnan-group/">Population and Statistical Genetics</a> group at the <a href="https://ceh.ku.dk/">CEH</a>, where I am working on incorporating in the microbiome in the study of domestication.
